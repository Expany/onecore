### onecore - The single file CMS

**onecore** consists of one single file which contains the onecore-source (PHP 5) and the content of the website, too. Imagine, you have one HTML site - a manual, a frontpage, a linklist or something like that - and you want to edit this page without any external editor. Then onecore is perfect for you. Onecore is HTML page and content in one file.

The website and some documentation can be found under http://www.remofritzsche.com/projects/onecore/.
